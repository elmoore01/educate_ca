#On behalf of our distinguished board, our partners and supporters, it is my pleasure to welcome you to Educate California and our LifePrep Academy program .

    Our mission is to empower California parents and families to prepare their children for college, careers and life after high school .

Since 1998, we have partnered with schools and non-profit organizations to increase parent and family engagement, by providing resources and services historically provided by counselors . Our resources and workshops are vital due to California's current average student-to-counselor ratio of more than 600 students per counselor.

Educate California also provides customized workshops, training and resources to empower schools and non-profit organizations that serve low-income youth and families .
